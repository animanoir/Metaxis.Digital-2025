### ðŸ“– What We're Reading
## "**The Aesthetic of Play**" by **Brian Upton**:

> In "The Aesthetic of Play," game designer Brian Upton analyzes the fundamental human experience of play, which predates culture and is observable in animals. He notes the lack of a critical language for play despite the ancient history of games. Upton offers a framework to understand how play unfolds and how rules shape it, using examples from various games. He also explores play's broader role in constructing meaning and its relationship to reality, drawing on epistemology, neuroscience, and semiotics. Ultimately, Upton argues that a play-based perspective can illuminate the structure of narratives across different media, including books, music, and art, and even clarify critical engagement itself.
